import { TypeTable } from 'next-docs-ui/components/type-table'

We offer developers an easy to access method for fetching our
websites statistics, these statistics include: total images stored,
total registered users and total uploaded files (downloads).

These statistics show no real purpose other then showing the world
how our website is performing in terms of its user, image and download
count. We strive for transparency and figured this would help us achieve it.
