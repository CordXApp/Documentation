import { TypeTable } from 'next-docs-ui/components/type-table'

We offer an api for checking our service status in a variety of different
ways all of which will be explained and described here, however we should
mention that some of our status endpoints may be limited or unavailable for
public viewing as this was mainly made to control the new status page that will
be coming with the release of v3 of our website!

## Public Endpoints

        "url": "https://cordx.instatus.com",
        "status": "UP"
