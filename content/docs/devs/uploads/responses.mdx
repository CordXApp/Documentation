import { TypeTable } from 'next-docs-ui/components/type-table'

Our upload server will return a wide variety of responses based on the provided headers 
and parameters for the request. for example if you provide a invalid secret the server will 
respond with a invalid secret message.

<Callout title="NOTE" type="info">
    ShareX may throw errors that have nothing to do with a failure in our upload server, these errors will not 
    be listed on this page and if you get one **or any error at all** you can join our 
    [Discord Server](https://cordx.lol/discord) for support.
