import { TypeTable } from 'next-docs-ui/components/type-table'

Our upload server is used to send `POST` requests containing files uploaded through
sharex to our website, database and bucket/cdn. You can interact with it outside of
sharex so long as you have basic knowledge regarding using a restful api!

---

## Base URL

> `https://beta.cordx.lol/api/upload/sharex`

---

## Note

-   Your `userid` and `secret` can be obtained in your `/me/config` page on our website
    or by using our [discord bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=829634899748716546&permissions=49450776919873&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

-   Uploaded files are currently limited to a max size of `50MB`

## Required headers

<TypeTable
    type={{
        userid: {
            description: 'The header containing the request users id',
            type: 'STRING'
        },
        secret: {
            description: 'The cordx secret belonging to the request user',
            type: 'STRING'
        }
    }}
/>

## Example request

```js title="Javascript Example"
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const fs = require('fs');

const stats = fs.statSync("YOUR_FILE.png");
const fileSizeInBytes = stats.size;
let readStream = fs.createReadStream('YOUR_FILE.png');

const customHeaders = {
    "Content-Length": fileSizeInBytes,
    "Content-Type": "image/png",
    "userid": "YOUR_USER_ID",
    "secret": "YOUR_CORDX_SECRET",
}

await fetch('beta.cordx.lol/api/upload/sharex', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: customHeaders,
    body: readStream
}).then(async function(res) => {

    await console.log(res.json());
    return res.json();
}).catch((e) => console.log(e.stack));

```
