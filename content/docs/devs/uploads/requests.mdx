import { TypeTable } from 'next-docs-ui/components/type-table'

Our upload server is used to send `POST` requests containing files uploaded through
sharex to our website, database and bucket/cdn. You can interact with it outside of
sharex so long as you have basic knowledge regarding using a restful api!

---

## Base URL

> `https://cordx.lol/api/upload/sharex`

---

## Required headers

<TypeTable
    type={{
        userid: {
            description: 'The header containing the request users id',
            type: 'STRING'
        },
        secret: {
            description: 'The cordx secret belonging to the request user',
            type: 'STRING'
        }
    }}
/>

## Basic Usage

Before you get started please make sure you:
1. **Prepare your file for upload:** The file you want to upload should be included in the body of the POST request. 
   - The maximum file size is currently `500 MB` for all users.
2. **Set the necessary headers**: Include the following headers in your request:
   - `secret`: This should be the secret associated with your user account.
   - `userid`: This should be your Discord User ID/Snowflake.
3. **Send the POST request:** You can use any HTTP client to achieve this.

<Callout title="NOTE" type="info">
    - custom domains can interact with this api using the `/api/upload/sharex` endpoint!
    - Your `userid` and `secret` can be obtained in your `/me/config` page or by using the `/profile` command in our [discord bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=829634899748716546&permissions=49450776919873&scope=bot%20applications.commands)!
</Callout>

### Curl Example
```shell
curl -X POST -H "secret: your-secret" -H "userid: your-userid" -F "file=@path-to-your-file" https://cordx.lol/api/upload/sharex
```

### Fetch Example

<Callout title="NOTE" type="info">
    - Both `fetch` and `formData` are built in libraries/API's.
    - This code should serve only as a template and may not work.
    - `sharex` is a File object representing the file to upload
</Callout>

```ts
const formData = new FormData();

formData.append('sharex', file);

const response = await fetch('https://cordx.lol/api/upload/sharex', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'secret': 'your-secret',
    'userid': 'your-userid'
  },
  body: formData
});

if (response.ok) {
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
} else {
  console.error('Upload failed');
}
```
