Hey there, thanks for stopping by and checking out our developer documentation
here you can find up-to date and informative information regarding both our
restful backend api and our upload server.

---

## Restful API

Our restful api is currently a blazing fast server made with some of the
hottest technology around including: fastify and mysql. It offers our developers
with variety of endpoints, controllers and middleware for them to interact with
and customize their CordX Experience behind their own code.

## Upload Server

Our upload server is what you trigger sharex to send requests to when uploading
your files. Though we prefer you to use sharex you can trigger requests directly
to our upload server in the event you want to upload images using a different method!
details on this can also be found here.
