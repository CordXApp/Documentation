We offer a over-complex and user-friendly domain name system to provide
our users with a wide variety of domains and sub-domains for them to
choose from when interacting with or uploading to our production website
including our exclusive "Bring your own domain" system.

## Using a domain

To use a domain other then our base `cordx.lol` domain simply visit the website
and re-download your config using the domain you want to use instead! Our config
generator is set-up to assign the config whatever domain the website is being viewed
from.

## Bring your own domain

Using your own domain with our services is actually quite simple
if you have been given an account on our production website just
follow the steps below and we will get you set up!

-   1. Create a proxied `CNAME` dns record for your domain/sub-domain with a content value of `cname.cordx.lol` (**NOTE:** if you are using cloudflare you can assign a wildcard using `*` for the name)
    -   Example: ![Cloudflare Sample](/domains/records.png)
-   2. Navigate to your domains `SSL/TLS` section and make sure the encryption mode is set to `Full`
    -   Example: ![SSL Sample](/domains/encryption.png)
-   3. Navigate to your domains caching/configuration section and purge everything
    -   Example: ![Caching Sample](/domains/caching.png)

**If your domain does not propagate or respond after 24 hours please contact our [Support Team](https://discord.gg/r78bkXWKYS)**
