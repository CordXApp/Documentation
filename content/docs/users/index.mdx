Here at CordX we offer our users a wide variety of features, configuration
abilities and more. All this would be useless with no tutorials or guides on
how to use these features and get the best use out of our services.

## Before you start

Please keep in mind that currently any beta or development releases of our website
are subject to change at any time. What you see when interacting with said websites
may not be the permanent finished result. To keep things simple we will provide some
options for you below that allow you to choose between our [production](https://cordx.lol) and
[beta](https://beta.cordx.lol)/[development](https://dev.cordx.lol) websites and their features
