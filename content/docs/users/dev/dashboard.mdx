Your user dashboard is your main step to using and interacting with
both our website and your uploaded files, images etc. It can be kind of
complex so we will lay out the key parts of it and their usage for you below.

---

## Overview

Your overview is the main section of your dashboard and displays key statistics
and information such as how many images you have stored:

![Overview Sample](/dash/overview.png)

---

## Limits

Currently to keep things simple and running smoothly during our development stages
the website and upload server only allow users to have a max storage/folder size of
2,000MB, how much storage you have used vs how much you have left will be displayed
in your dashboard and looks something like this:

![Usage Sample](/dash/stats.png)

---

## Folder

Your "folder" is the location in our database and website where your uploads are stored
in the event that we our services fail to create your folder you can create/save it in
your dashboard (Please make sure the folder name represents your discord id or the site will face issues):

## Webhooks

> NOTE: your webhook link can be found/created in the `/interactions > webhooks` section of your discord channel settings

This is our favorite part of the user dashboard and we hope you will love it as much
as we do, as of `v2.x` of CordX we allow users to receive a discord message to any
discord channel they choose using webhooks, your webhook can be set in your dashboard
and saved using the "save webhook" button:

![Webhook Config Sample](/dash/hook_set.png)

The webhooks that will be sent look something like this:

## Your Config

> \***\*WARNING\*\***: do not share your config with **anyone** ever.

Your ShareX Config is a json based file that we automatically create for you to add to
ShareX and tell it where to send your uploads/screenshots. Without this config ShareX will
have absolutely no idea how to interact with our website.

To download your config simply use the "Download ShareX Config" button located in your dashboard

![Config Sample](/dash/config.png)

To make ShareX use your config simply head over to your "Downloads" folder or wherever you allowed
your computer to download it to, double click on the `CordX.sxcu` file and click yes when ShareX
asks if you want to use this config:

## Your Secret

> \***\*WARNING\*\***: do not share your secret with **anyone** ever.

Your secret is how you and sharex communicate with both our api and upload server for things such as
image, file and video uploads, you can also use this secret to send your own requests to our
upload server and/or api.

To view your secret you will notice some "blurred" text in the "options" section of your dashboard
you can view your secret by hovering over the blurred text or clicking on it for "mobile/tablet" users

![View Secret](/dash/sec_view.png)

To copy or reset your secret you can use either the "Copy Secret" or "Reset Secret" buttons located
in the same section of your dashboard. Please note that resetting your secret also means it will
invalidate any sharex request made using that secret so you will need to re-download your config.
