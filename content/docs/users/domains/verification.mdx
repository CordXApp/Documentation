With the release of our custom domain support, we have decided to do everything we can to make sure
domains aren't abused or falsely claimed. to achieve this we require users to verify a txt record
on-top of adding our custom cname record.

## Verification

if you recently added your domain to our website and need to verify it then follow the steps listed
below and we will help get you setup.

<Callout title="IMPORTANT" type="warn">
    even after completing the steps listed below it could take some time for your dns changes to propagate, if you leave
    our verification page open we will recheck it for you automatically every 2 minutes.
</Callout>

        ### Grab your verification info 
        
        This can be found on the `/verify` page of our website. What you need is the domain and the content.

        <Callout title="NOTE" type="info">
            you should also copy the url and save it for later as it contains the domain param you need to get back here
            if you happen to leave this page ![verify](/dash/verification-page.png)
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Head over to cloudflare

        Visit your domains dashboard within cloudflare and navigate to the `DNS > Records` section ![yes yes](/dash/dns-records.png)
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Create a new txt record

        Click on the blue `add record` button you need to set up the record to match the information on the verification page,
        so you want to set the records type to `TXT`, set the name to `@` and set the content to the content shown on your
        verification page. Example below ðŸ‘‡ ![txt record](/dash/txt-record.png)
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Save your changes

        Leave the record attributes empty and save your changes, once your changes have saved navigate to `caching > configuration`
        and click the `purge everything` button ðŸ‘‡ ![caching ok](/domains/caching.png)
    </Step>

</Steps>

now that you have completed the verification process while we wait for the changes to propagate we can head over to the
[Domain Setup](/docs/users/domains/setup) section to setup the needed cname record.
