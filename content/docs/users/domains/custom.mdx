## Add your domain

To get started with a custom domain you first need to add it to your CordX Account, to do that navigate to your
`/me/settings` page on the CordX Website, you can get there through the User Navigation (see the image below)

Once you are on the settings page, you will see a section that says `"Add a domain"` with a input field below it,
you can type/add your domain here (without the protocol) for example `img.cordx.lol` after you add your domain, you
will be prompted with a pop up saying that your domain needs to be verified ðŸ‘‡
![ok](/dash/pop-up.png)

once you receive this pop up just hang out for a few seconds and the website will automatically redirect you to the
verification page ðŸ‘‡

Now that you are here you can continue on to the [Verification](/docs/users/domains/verification) step.
