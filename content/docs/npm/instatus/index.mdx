We understand that not everyone likes interacting with a raw api and
we ourselves have searched far and wide for a npm module for instatus
that offers all the tools and utilities needed to integrate instatus
with our websites, clients and more. Unfortunately there is a limited
number of options. So we made this module to bridge that gap!
